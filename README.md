# Biodiversity_PlotlyJS
------------------------------------

### Overview
------------

In this deliverable, we'll build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ , which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this project, we'll use Plotly library for JS and execute code to create graphs, bar charts bubble charts etc.


### Resources
